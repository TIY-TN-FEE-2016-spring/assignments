# Surf and Paddle

## Description

As a developer on the web, you will often be tasked with creating an html page simply from a designer's photo.
In this assignment, you'll be taking an image and turning it into a functioning website.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Create semantic HTML for a full page and layout
* Understand and able to leverage the many css properties to style content.
* Use CSS to create layout for the HTML page.


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* Use semantic html tags where needed
* Effectively utilize some common css flex box for layouts
* Able to leverage and understand the use of flexbox, floats, and position in context of positioning (most of the layout should be flexbox or no positioning work).
* The menu items need to also have differing states based on a hover, and although not articulated in the provided image, they need to be styled.

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `index.html`
  * `app.css`
  * `images/`

### Requirements

* The resulting web page cannot just be an image of the assignment centered on the page :)

## Normal Mode

Using the image below, create a html document using html and css to look like below, but be a function website:

![Surf and paddle image](assets/surf-and-paddle.png)

## Hard Mode

Complete Normal Mode then make the website fully responsive and adhering to this [responsive wireframe](assets/surf-and-paddle-responsive.pdf).

## Tips

Most of this layout and site can be accomplished with flexbox layouts.
The hero area in the banner will need to use `position: absolution` and transform centering.
The footer Other Post Items will also use some `position` to get the titles to show above each image.

For now, ignore the icons and blue overlays for the pictures at the bottom.
