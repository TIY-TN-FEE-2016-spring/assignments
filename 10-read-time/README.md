# Read Time

## Description

Now that we have worked with Javascript, it's time to show things to our users.
In this assignment, you'll be recreating the read time calculator from Medium.com

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Use existing functions to create more complex behavior
* Work with strings using the `split` function
* Create elements using `document.createElement`
* Lookup elements using `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`
* Add items to the DOM elements using `appendChild`
* Understand using `innerText`
* Add classes to elements using `.classList.add`

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* Decide steps to take based on failing tests
* Create small Javascript functions
* Use existing functions to create more complex behavior
* Work with strings using the `split` function
* Create elements using `document.createElement`
* Lookup elements using `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`
* Add items to the DOM elements using `appendChild`
* Understand using `innerText`
* Add classes to elements using `.classList.add`

## Details

### Deliverables

* A project forked from the [`10-read-time` Repository](https://github.com/TIY-TN-FEE-2016-spring/10-read-time)

### Requirements

Make all tests pass by implementing and filling in the functions.
