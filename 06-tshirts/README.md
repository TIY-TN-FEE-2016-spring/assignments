# TShirts

## Description

Working with user state and varying display sizes is a common occurrence when working with CSS.
Usually responsive designs are simple breakdowns in grid size.
Other times, the design changes more drastically to make the UI easier to use.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Use Pseudo Selectors (`:first-of-type`, `:last-of-type`, `:hover`, etc.) to style elements
* Use Media Queries

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* Use flex-box to create a grid with gutters
* Use flex-box to stack content
* Use `flex-grow` and `min-width` to make a responsive grid
* Organize SASS using variables
* Organize SASS using `@import` statements
* Create SASS code free of linting errors
* Use Pseudo Selectors in CSS/SCSS
* Use Media Queries in CSS/SCSS
* Use `position: relative` and `position: absolute` to create tool tips
