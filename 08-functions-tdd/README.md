# Functions Test Driven

## Description

We're starting Javascript together.
Let's check that you are comfortable with `if`, `else`, and `for` structures.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Decide steps to take based on failing tests
* Manage `for` loops over Arrays
* Use `if` and `else` statements

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* Decide steps to take based on failing tests
* Manage `for` loops over Arrays
* Use `if` and `else` statements

## Details

### Deliverables

* A project forked from the [`08-functions-tdd` Repository](https://github.com/TIY-TN-FEE-2016-spring/08-functions-tdd)

### Requirements

Make all tests pass by implementing and filling in the functions.


## Tasks
