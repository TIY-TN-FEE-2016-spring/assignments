# Functions Test Driven

## Description

We're jumping into the craziness of scope, classes, and constructors.
This assignment will help to enforce these and guide you through this process.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Decide steps to take based on failing tests
* Define/Declare `class`es
* Create instances of `class`es using the `new` keyword
* Use scoping within `class` constructors to create "private" properties

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* Decide steps to take based on failing tests
* Define/Declare `class`es
* Create instances of `class`es using the `new` keyword
* Use scoping within `class` constructors to create "private" properties

## Details

### Deliverables

* A project forked from the [`09-classes-tdd` Repository](https://github.com/TIY-TN-FEE-2016-spring/09-classes-tdd)

### Requirements

Make all tests pass by implementing and filling in the functions.
